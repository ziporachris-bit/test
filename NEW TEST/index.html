        What's the worlds view on mental health awareness?
        talk shows are organized on mental health in Nigeria and lots more but trust me
        , 80% of Nigeria 
        only see mental health awareness as a meduim to reach out to
        individuals struggling with suicide, but <strong>SPEAK NIGERIA</strong> sees it from every angle, and 
        just because your'e not yet suicidal doesn't mean you shouldn't be part of the mental health awareness scheme.
        Wer'e here to help.

        find ourselves in, isn't one to understand, support and even want to normalise therapy for people
