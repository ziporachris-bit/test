                Speak Nigeria is a platform aiming to give a voice to people struggling with mental‑health challenges.
                You don't need someone to "fix" you — you're not a problem or a burden. You're unique. Getting better
                is an achievement; don't rush to prove anything to anyone.

            <h2>Why are we called SPEAK NIGERIA?</h2>
            <p>
                We represent what many cannot: the courage to speak. As Nigerians, many struggle to find an open space
                to talk about mental health. We want to give you a voice, remove the thorns around your neck, and
                support recovery from every angle.

            <h2>Why use this site?</h2>
            <p>
                Much public discussion on mental health focuses on crisis only. SPEAK NIGERIA addresses prevention,
                support and everyday wellbeing. You don't need to be suicidal to get involved.
            </p>
